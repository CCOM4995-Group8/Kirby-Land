# Kirby-Land

Firstly, we made our Kirby from 3D objects (Spheres and Capsules):

This is what his face looks like:

Afterwards, we added his arms and legs with compressed spheres, then we put it all under the empty space we called "Kirby" so it would all move under one unit:

Then we clicked and dragged the kirby into a folder we made in our assets called "Prefabs":

Now that we have Original Kirby as a prefab, we right clicked on the Kirby and duplicated it.
Then, we used cylinders, compressed spheres, and scaled down cubes to make a Bow and Arrow, and a hat for Kirby.

Now we have our first variant, Archer Kirby:

To make it into a variant, we dragged it down into the prefabs folder and clicked on "Prefab Variant":

Then we duplicated the original Kirby again and made Bomb Kirby. We used a stack of small capsules on top of another
to create a cone-like shape to make a hat, then we simply took a sphere and a cylinder to make a bomb item:

Now we have our second variant, Bomb Kirby:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76eee1f8-06ce-4f6c-af42-fe2935972740)

Then, we once again drag it into the Prefabs folder and click on "Prefab Variant."

Finally, for the last Kirby, we duplicated the original again and made Ninja Kirby. For his bandana, we
used 2 small rods made from cubes to make eyebrows in order for him to have an angry expression.
Then, we used 4 stretched and flattened out cubes to make his bandana:

For the finishing touches, we used a capsule, a compressed sphere and another stretched flattened out cube to
make his katana on his back:

Then we have our final variant, the Ninja Kirby:

Four Kirby Prefabs:

Now that we have our four Kirby Prefabs, it's time to make the terrain.
To make the terrain, we right click, the same thing we do to add 3D objects,
but instead we add a terrain:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/869d0d47-5f4d-47f4-a7ea-952e9a065ecd)

Once the terrain is there, we click on it to inspect it, then press on terrain settings on the right side
of the screen:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef060a0e-0ff6-4d6e-abfc-4ab331ed708d)

Once in terrain settings, we scroll down until we see Mesh Resolutions, then we change the values of
"Terrain Width," "Terrain Height," and "Terrain Lenght" to 250:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ada760c-2698-4135-a6ec-a289258920ee)

In that same place, we look a little lower in Terrain Resolutions and change the Heightmap Resolution to 257 x 257:

Looking at the Puerto Rico map, we decided to make it based off this northern area in the map:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dc8d1ab-27ad-4da9-9c69-4b6b1e57da8c)

In order to edit the terrain, we go back up to the terrain settings and click on "Paint Terrain:"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ac2f86-c80d-468a-81fa-e8ba7e2da462)

Once there, we selected brush 4 with a size of 30 and opacity of 15 and began terraforming our terrain:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1d779b0-f914-4b9f-a72c-15022a367373)

Once the layout was done, we moved over to brush 5 to give it more detail and make it look more natural:

Here is the final terrain and a comparison:

With our terrain complete we placed the Kirbys around the map.

Bomb Kirby in a hole he made by blowing it up:

Ninja Kirby hiding behind terrain for a sneak attack:

Archer Kirby in a high spot to take aim:

Original Kirby exploring the land for the first time in search for powers:

What we learned from this is the incredible shapos and cool characters we can make with out limited resources as long as
we are creative enough to think about it and make it. Aditionally, we realized how important a detail is to make a character
different from the others. Finally, we learned how useful Prefabs are, especially when we are going to place more than one
of the same or similar characters.

Each of us has a story related to Kirby we would like to share.

Jose S. Pena:

  Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing Kirby's Return to Dreamland on my Nintendo Wii. I remember I used to rent it from the Blockbusters 
store near my house. I also used to play him a lot in Super Smash Bros Brawl on the Nintendo Wii. To this day, I wish I would've simply bought 
the game instead of renting it over and over again, because I loved it. Now, recently, a new Kirby's Dream Land game released  for the Nintendo 
Switch, and it brought many memories from when I was younger. The  game is very fun to play alone and with friends, since you can all become
Kirby and use different abilities, or you could play as different characters like Meta Knight and King Dedede. Alas, I am very happy to be able 
to  make my own Kirbys in my own project, since I have always been a Kirby fan.

David Carballeira:

  Kirby is a very recognizible character in the world of video games. What makes Kirby unique is his ability to inhale enemies to absorb
their powers. One of his games that best represents this is Kirby Super Star Ultra for the Nintendo DS. I'll always remember all the different
power-ups to choose from, as well as the CPU allies you could create with them. Kirby Super Star Ultra is the perfect game for anyone who doesn't
know Kirby to get a great gaming experience with him. The game is full of fun and exciting adventures, as well as some challeging and rewarding fights.

Michael Rodriguez:

  To me, Kirby stands out as one of the most charming and unique characters in all of him. His design is extremely simple, yet his abilities and
complex in a very fun way. One of my favorite versions of Kirby is from Super Smash Bros, as he's one of the most user-friendly characters in the game.
With his easy-to-learn moves, impressive recovery ability, and the sheer fun of using his inhale abilty to absorb the powers of every other fighter
in the game. Not only is he super adorable, but he's also very efficient in fighting. Whether you've played any Kirby games before or not, 
you are guaranteed to have fun if you played Kirby in this game, as I did.
